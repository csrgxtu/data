****** cryptography 101 ******

***** Preface *****
I always think it will be cool to hide your message with cryptography, what’s
more is that even though the others got your message, he still can not get what
you trying to say, because the message he get is a messed up information that
is useless for him.
I always think it will be cool to speack a language that is loud and quick, and
when you speack it, nobody understands what you are saying. but this one comes
to the other languages.
In this series of articles, i am gonna to illustrate the concept of the
cryptography and the implementation. more on implementation precisely.
cryptography is a field that is full of interesting things, and a lot of
tricks. so let’s get started.
***** what in this article *****
In this article, I am focus on a simple trick. a trick that represents the
original english strings with it’s ASCII numbers. so the idea is simple if you
know the ASCII. generally speacking, for every english characters that can be
printed on the screen, there is a conrespond decimal number. so one way is you
store you original information into a plain text, the other way is to use the
decimal number representation store the information. for example, suppose you
have a string message says “Hello, blogxtu“, then the decimal format will be “/
d72/d101/d108/d108/d111/d44/d32/d98/d108/d111/d103/d120/d116/d117“, if someone
sees this decimal format, he will need to be smart enough to figure out what it
is trying to say.
The idea is simple, so the code is also simple. I use Python implement this
idea, but if you got it, you can implement it with any programming language.
here is my code: strdigit.py
 
#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# Author: Archer
# File: strdigit.py
# Date: 16/Dec/2013
# Des: this script is used to convert a string into its digit reperentation.
#
# Produced By CSRGXTU

import sys

# Des: function load_data is used to load the raw data from file into a
#   string
#
# @param filename
# @return string or none on error
def load_data(filename = None):
    # First, check out the parameter
    if filename == None:
        return None

    # Second, open the file for read
    input_fh = open(filename, 'r')

    # Third, read the entire file into the string
    tmpstr = input_fh.read()

    # Finally, return the result
    return tmpstr

# Des: function save_to_file is used to save a string into file
#
# @param filename, string
# @return ture or false
def save_to_file(filename = None, string = None):
    # First, check out the parameter
    if filename == None or string == None:
        return False

    # Second, open file for write
    output_fh = open(filename, 'w')

    # Third, write the string into the file
    output_fh.write(string)

    # Finally, close file and return true
    output_fh.close()
    return True

# Des: function str_to_digit is used to transcode the char in a string
#   into it's ascii digit, like 'aa' to '\d97\d97'.
#
# @param str
# @return str or none on error
def str_to_digit(string = None):
    # First, check out the parameter
    if string == None:
        return None

    # Second, in a loop, transcode
    tmpstr = ''
    for char in string:
        #sys.stdout.write(char)
        tmpstr += '/d' + str(ord(char))

    # remove the first '' character in tmpstr
    #tmpstr = tmpstr[1:]

    # Finally, return the string
    return tmpstr

# Des: function digit_to_str is used to convert a string of digit into a
#   a meaningful string
#
# @param string
# @return string or None on error
def digit_to_str(string = None):
    # First, check out the parameter
    if string == None:
        return None

    # Second, loop the string and split it
    tmplist = string.split('/d')
    # remove the first '' character
    tmplist = tmplist[1:]
    tmplist = map(int, tmplist)
    tmpstr = ''
    for item in tmplist:
        #sys.stdout.write(chr(item))
        tmpstr += chr(item)

    # Finally, return the string
    return tmpstr

tmpstr = raw_input()
tmpstr = str_to_digit(tmpstr)
print tmpstr
tmpstra = digit_to_str(tmpstr)
print tmpstra
The code isn’t that much difficult too read, if you have some suggestions on
the code, I will be glad to hear your voice.

      Awesome blog you have here but I was curious about if you knew of any
      community forums that cover the same topics discussed in this article?
      Iâd really love to be a part of group where I can get suggestions from
      other experienced people that share the same interest. If you have any
      recommendations, please let me know. Many thanks!

            well, i believe there will or already have, I am learning
            cryptography from a book.

      This can be a great write-up. Thank you for bothering to explain this all
      out for us. It is actually a fantastic guide!

      Use it or lose it! I teach at a Christian School and I introduce the
      students to the Greek behind English words. There is currently a student
      who wants to get together and learn Hebrew with me! These cards would be
      great!!
