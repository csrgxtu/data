***** Manually_install_Sun_JDK_on_Ubuntu_Linux *****
Posted on February_23,_2014 by Archer_Reilly
***** A little word about Java *****
Java is a programming language originally developed by Sun Corporation, it is
objecte orinted. it is very easy to get to use, but it is not good at
performance. still Java is a popular programming language around the world,
especially in China. I have seen there are a lot of not much clever programmers
who learns Java everyday. Not for the popular of the Apache_Foundation, I won’t
take time to learn this crap.(apologise for my rudeness, It is not Java itself
sometimes, it is because I have seen too much Chinese stick into Java, use Java
develop everything, as far as know, that the YouTube, Facebook, Google are not
implemented by Java, but I don’t know what’s going on in my country, everybody
stick into Java!)
***** Why I write this post to illustrate how to install Java manually? *****
Well, if you are using Ubuntu as your working environment, then it is pretty
easy to install Java. you can type javac and javaÂ in the terminal, and the
Ubuntu system will give you a hint on how to install Java quickly, like
following:
archer@csrgxtu3:~$ java
The program 'java' can be found in the following packages:
 * default-jre
 * gcj-4.6-jre-headless
 * openjdk-6-jre-headless
 * gcj-4.5-jre-headless
 * openjdk-7-jre-headless
Try: sudo apt-get install  <selected package>
If you do as what the system indicates you, this is ok, the apt package manager
will spread the installed package around your system. but this way isn’t good
if you reinstall your system, for you will need to reinstall Java after you
reinstalling the system. I am a big fan of the Linux operating system, I try
different Linux distributions from time to time, means I need to reinstall Java
everytime. so I decided this time install the JDK into my home(data) partions,
thus everytime i install a new system, i won’t need to reinstall Java(home
partions contains all of the user data, so I don’t format this partion when i
install a new system).
***** How to manually install? *****
First, you need to download the jdk file from Oracle’s website. click here to
download the package.(note: if you are in 64 bit systems, please download the
64 bit version jdk, i am assuming you are using 32 bit machine).
jdk-7u51-linux-i586.tar.gz
Second, untar the downloaded file.
tar xvf jdk-7u51-linux-i586.tar.gz
 
Third, edit the .bashrc file to add the environment PATH
# Add for jdk manual install
PATH="$HOME/bin/jdk1.7.0_45/bin:$PATH"
 
Fouth, make PATH take effect.
 source /home/$USER/.bashrc
now, the java is installed on your system, you can type following command to
verify that.
which java
if upper command is ok, then it should outputs the path where java command
locates.
To be honest, I like working in the terminal, but when you program Java, you
need a IDE, for instance, eclipse or netbeans. but when you use this IDE, it
take too much CPU load. I want to say that i will stick with terminal, and i
found it just worked fine until now.

***** Cryptology_102_—_Substitution *****
Posted on February_18,_2014 by Archer_Reilly
***** What is substitution in Cryptology? *****
well, there are mainly two categories in cryptology, one is classical, the
other is contemporary. and substitution belongs to classical cryptology.
substituion is a little like one to one relationship in function. every
character in the plain text will be replaced by another character — crypted
character. for example, use crypted character a to represent plain character b,
use crypted char b represent plain char c, etc, thus, Continue_reading_→

***** cryptography_101 *****
Posted on December_16,_2013 by Archer_Reilly
***** Preface *****
I always think it will be cool to hide your message with cryptography, what’s
more is that even though the others got your message, he still can not get what
you trying to say, because the message he get is a messed up information that
is useless for him.
I always think it will be cool to speack a language that is loud and quick, and
when you speack it, nobody understands what you are saying. but this one comes
to the other languages.
In this series of articles, i am gonna to illustrate the concept of the
cryptography and the implementation. more on implementation precisely.
cryptography is a field that is full of interesting things, and a lot of
tricks. so let’s get started. Continue_reading_→

***** Programming_Challenge:_Sum_Square_Difference *****
Posted on December_15,_2013 by Archer_Reilly
***** Problem description *****
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + … + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + … + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 [â] 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum. Continue_reading_→

To let the browser play video is a tedious work, here is a video in two
formats: MP4 and OGV,Â  if you are using Firefox and Chome, it should be no
problem, but if you are using IE, then it won’t play, technically IE supports
MP4, but I don’t know why it doesn’tÂ  Play in thisÂ situation.

Many people want or need to have the connection between the browser and the Web
server encrypted, but aren’t been able to set it up. This guide is intended to
help people with the typical Apache on Linux setup to make encrypted
connections available with a minimum of fuss, and if the encrypted connection
isn’t for a commercial purpose, to do so without spending a penny. Continue
