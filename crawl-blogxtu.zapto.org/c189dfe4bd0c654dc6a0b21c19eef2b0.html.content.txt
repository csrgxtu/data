****** Manually install Sun JDK on Ubuntu Linux ******
Posted on February_23,_2014 by Archer_Reilly
***** A little word about Java *****
Java is a programming language originally developed by Sun Corporation, it is
objecte orinted. it is very easy to get to use, but it is not good at
performance. still Java is a popular programming language around the world,
especially in China. I have seen there are a lot of not much clever programmers
who learns Java everyday. Not for the popular of the Apache_Foundation, I won’t
take time to learn this crap.(apologise for my rudeness, It is not Java itself
sometimes, it is because I have seen too much Chinese stick into Java, use Java
develop everything, as far as know, that the YouTube, Facebook, Google are not
implemented by Java, but I don’t know what’s going on in my country, everybody
stick into Java!)
***** Why I write this post to illustrate how to install Java manually? *****
Well, if you are using Ubuntu as your working environment, then it is pretty
easy to install Java. you can type javac and javaÂ in the terminal, and the
Ubuntu system will give you a hint on how to install Java quickly, like
following:
archer@csrgxtu3:~$ java
The program 'java' can be found in the following packages:
 * default-jre
 * gcj-4.6-jre-headless
 * openjdk-6-jre-headless
 * gcj-4.5-jre-headless
 * openjdk-7-jre-headless
Try: sudo apt-get install  <selected package>
If you do as what the system indicates you, this is ok, the apt package manager
will spread the installed package around your system. but this way isn’t good
if you reinstall your system, for you will need to reinstall Java after you
reinstalling the system. I am a big fan of the Linux operating system, I try
different Linux distributions from time to time, means I need to reinstall Java
everytime. so I decided this time install the JDK into my home(data) partions,
thus everytime i install a new system, i won’t need to reinstall Java(home
partions contains all of the user data, so I don’t format this partion when i
install a new system).
***** How to manually install? *****
First, you need to download the jdk file from Oracle’s website. click here to
download the package.(note: if you are in 64 bit systems, please download the
64 bit version jdk, i am assuming you are using 32 bit machine).
jdk-7u51-linux-i586.tar.gz
Second, untar the downloaded file.
tar xvf jdk-7u51-linux-i586.tar.gz
 
Third, edit the .bashrc file to add the environment PATH
# Add for jdk manual install
PATH="$HOME/bin/jdk1.7.0_45/bin:$PATH"
 
Fouth, make PATH take effect.
 source /home/$USER/.bashrc
now, the java is installed on your system, you can type following command to
verify that.
which java
if upper command is ok, then it should outputs the path where java command
locates.
To be honest, I like working in the terminal, but when you program Java, you
need a IDE, for instance, eclipse or netbeans. but when you use this IDE, it
take too much CPU load. I want to say that i will stick with terminal, and i
found it just worked fine until now.
