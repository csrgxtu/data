****** Blogxtu SEO 101 — Install WordPress In Lamp ******
Posted on December_14,_2013 by Archer_Reilly
***** Summary *****
This Blogxtu SEO serials will show you the way that let the word know your
website. I will start at the beginning, but assume something basic knowledge
you already know.
In this article, I will show you how to install WordPress on Lamp in Ubuntu
Server 12.04.
***** Backgrounds *****
**** platform ****
In this situation, I use Ubuntu 12.04 as my basic server, actually there are a
lot other operating systems you can chose to be your basic platform, such as
Centos, It will work on all platforms if you know that platform. to learn more
about Ubuntu server 12.04, click here. Here I assume that you already installed
the Ubuntu Server 12.04.
**** software ****
To make things simple, I will use LAMP on Ubuntu server, LAMP is short Linux,
Apache, Mysql, PHP/Perl/Python, a software bundle, used for website. and Ubuntu
already have the repositories for LAMP, it means that you can easily install
the LAMP on Ubuntu via a simple command. to install LAMP, just type:
sudo tasksel
and chose the LAMP and then press ok, it will then install LAMP automatically
on your system. here is what it looks:
[Install-LAMP-Ubuntu]
[Ubuntu-Lamp-Installing]
After installed LAMP, you can verify it by pointing your browser to http://
localhost, and it should looked like this:
Generally, the default documents root is placed under /var/www,  it only
contains a index.html file under /var/www, actually, when you point your
browser to the HTTP address http://localhost,the web server respond with the
index.html. you can simply put your website file under the diretory, and it
will work, but if you want some thing more advanced, you should use virtual
host on Apache, here I will not illustrate how to set virtual host on Apache.
***** Installing WordPress *****
Really, what is wordpress? wordpress is a open sourced software that enables
you build  your own blog site very quickly and with no difficulties. for
detailed information, click here.
First, download the wordpress source file. click here to download.
Second, decompress the source file into the /var/www, here is the command to do
it.
unzip latest.zip
sudo mv wordpress/* /var/www
Third, create the database and user to use the database.
mysql -uroot -p
create database wordpress default character set utf8;
grant all on wordpress.* to ‘wordpress’@'localhost’ identified by ‘wordpress’
Fourth, create a simple configuration file for wordpress.
cd /var/www
cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
edit wp-config.php and change the contents accordingly, mainly the database
name and the username to login the database.
Fifth, point your browser to the HTTP address http://localhost/index.php,and
then the rest is very easy, just follow the instructions you will install the
wordpress on your system.
