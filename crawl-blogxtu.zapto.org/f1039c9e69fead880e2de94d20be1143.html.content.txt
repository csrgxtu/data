***** What is blogxtu? *****
blogxtu is a self-hosted blog, a combination of the english word blog and the
abbreviation of my school name XTU — XiangTan_University.
***** What is blogxtu used for? *****
blogxtu is used to as a place to share ideas, to learn things about computer
science. it focus the theory and practice at the same time. it will contain
things from little to big as long as it is worthing to be considered.
***** Why I started blogxtu? *****
Since I started to learn web programming, I want to own my own website on my
own machine with proporiate software. due to the underlining reasons, I can’t
start a fully functional website.
I Googled around, found both Google and WordPress provide free blog service for
normal user. I tried both blog service and it works really well. but for one
reason I found it wasn’t work very well, it’s the availablity, since in China,
the government blocked some website, so without goagent, i can’t surf some
famous website, like YouTuBe, FaceBook etc.
Until one day, I found a part-time job in our school’s network center, and from
that time on, I started to realize the things was difficult for me are becoming
easy. I got a public IP address, I love Linux, and with some other knowledge, I
started my blog site: blogxtu.
But I am not waste time on just a functional website, there are a lot
interesting things happening every time, I need take time to learn new things,
and I need a place to share these things with the world.
